Another day, another unproductive day. I still do not have the habit of thinking about what needs to be done before I do anything. So in my work session, I just do what my head wants to do. Mostly video games and browsing web sites aimlessly. Because If i keep doing this, the semester will not be much different. I want to have many things. But that requires money. But money only comes from work. I cannot rely on my parents forever. That is a fact. I cannot use my lines to convince my parents to give money. But how much? That's the gist of it
