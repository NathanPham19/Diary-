 # The techinically second day of free time
 
 11:42 P.M

I don't have much time to write so I need to write this brief to maintain my streak to make this become a habit. So that I can use this habit to vent my frustrations, and 
to show what I need to improve for tomorrow. That's the point of writing journals for me.

Not everyone has the same goals when writing journals. But for me only, I want to become a more efficient person

Today, it is the second day on break. And I think my group mates just saved me from a failed class. But there are still some big problems that still persists in me. First,
I cannot regulate my playtime very well. When I set for 30 minutes. It usually goes 20 - 30 minutes of the mark. Second, when I do chores or do homework, my mind still
wander around other things. That's the main thing that is preventing me from getting better producticity done. One thing at a time, and gaming with restrictions!
