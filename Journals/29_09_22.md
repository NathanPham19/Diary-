Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam

This is the first day after of 3 days of not writing any journal. Normally, I would be hating myself for not remember to write for consecutive days.
But I have a different reaction to it now. I now feel relieve that I still remember and write it out. Lately, I recognize that my physical abilities is limited. I need to push myself more. Because increase in physical limit will also help with my focus in studying. 
Talk about procrastination, yeah they are still a lot of delays when I start a task and doing it. And sometimes, my brain just stop focus and wonder somewhere else. That is very annoying. I need to learn how to snap back into my work. I think it is caused by my bad habit while working. That will take some time. 
And when I wake up, I still want to stay in bed for a few more minutes. I think I want to stuck with my dreams a little bit more. That is the underlying reason I guess. I still do not have the habit of gettings done one at a time in a focused state.
And one more thing, I still work based on my feelings. Not based on a logical list, so if I follow this method into the next semester, I will face crunching once again, and crunching is not pretty at all. It is tiring and tiring and it makes me stressful. 

So one day streak for my journalling thing.
